# Introduction

ADK, MDT, and WDS each play distinct roles in the Microsoft **Windows deployment ecosystem**.  

## ADK

ADK (Windows **Assessment and Deployment Kit**) is a set of tools and technologies that help IT professionals customize, assess, and deploy Windows operating systems.  

It includes **utilities** to capture and apply Windows **images** and is foundational for deployment automation, often leveraged by MDT.  

## MDT 

MDT (**Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**) is a unified collection of tools, processes, and guidance **built on top of ADK** to automate the deployment of Windows desktops and servers.  

It helps create standardized Windows images and manages deployment through **task sequences** that orchestrate OS installation, driver injection, application installation, and configuration.  

MDT is designed for medium to large enterprises to reduce deployment time, ensure consistency, and facilitate upgrade and migration scenarios.

## WDS

WDS (**Windows Deployment Services**) is a **network-based** deployment server role in Windows Server.  

It enables the deployment of Windows OS images over the network using **PXE boot** technology.  

WDS is primarily responsible for hosting and delivering boot and install images to client machines.  
It is simpler than MDT and requires pre-built images, often created via **MDT** or other tools.  

WDS can deploy images to multiple machines simultaneously but lacks MDTâ€™s extensive automation and customization features.

## How they work together

- ADK provides the deployment tools and image management foundation
- MDT automates and orchestrates deployment workflows using ADK tools
- WDS handles network-based image delivery to client devices.

Often, MDT and WDS are **used together** for full deployment solutions, where MDT creates and customizes the deployment images and task sequences, while WDS delivers them over the network.

# Configuring an automated deployment ecosystem

- setting up the VMs via VMware Workstation or a similar tool
- setting up the WDS server 
- setting up the DHCP server (to allow PXE boot in both UEFI and BIOS modes)
- setting up ADK and MDT

## Setting up our Virtual Windows servers

We can use a tool like VMware Workstation to create our VMs.
- Once we have set up the ADDS (domain controller) server, we need to add the DHCP role to it.  
- After that, we need to set up a dedicated Windows Server VM with the WDS role
- The WDS server then needs to be joined to our AD domain
- It's **recommended** to create an NTFS partition on our WDS server. That partition will host our images, PXE boot files and other WDS-related files.
- We also need 2 PXE clients (W10 and W11) to test our PXE boot
  - For the Windows 10 client, we can modify the VM settings to test both BIOS and UEFI (with secure boot enabled or not)
  - For the Windows 11 client, we don't have a choice but to use UEFI (with secure boot enabled or not)

The IP addresses of our VMs can be 192.168.16.10 and 16.11 and 16.12, for example. They just need to be part of the same network.  

**Note**:  
Of course, our client VMs don't have any OS installed yet, we've just specified the future OS when creating the VMs via VMware Workstation.

## Setting up the WDS server

- WDS needs a **DHCP** server so it can deliver images via **PXE boot**
- A WDS server can either be independent (workgroup) or registered in an Active Directory domain
- WDS can provide 2 types of images: boot images (such as boot.wim) and installation images (such as installation.wim)

When a machine runs a PXE boot, its firmware uses one of these 2 modes:
- BIOS mode (also called "Legacy mode")
- UEFI mode (associated with secure boot)

**Note**:  
This is true for deploying Windows 10 images, but **Windows 11** requires to use **UEFI** to align with the **TPM 2.0** prerequisites.  

### Installing the WDS role on our WDS VM

- The VM is running Windows Server 2022 and has been joined to the AD domain provided by our ADDS/DHCP VM
- Open "Server Manager"
- Click on "Manage" and select "Add Roles and Features"
- Choose "Role-based or feature-based installation"
- Select the server where you want to install the role 
- In the list of roles, check "Windows Deployment Services"
- Click on Next until the Role Services selection
- Ensure both role services are selected: Deployment Server and Transport Server
- Click on "Install"

### Configuring WDS

- once the WDS role installed, open the Windows Deployment Services console
- in the left pane, open the servers section and right-click on the WDS server > Configure server
- 

## Setting up the DHCP server

### Prerequisite: ADDS + DNS

-  This VM will be running Windows Server 2022
-  

**Note**:  
When creating an Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) server, the DNS Server role is not automatically installed by default.  
But the AD DS installation wizard offers the option to automatically install and configure the DNS server.  
This automatic addition and configuration happen during the **promotion** of the server to a **domain controller**.  
The DNS zones created during this process are integrated with the AD DS domain namespace.

### Adding the DHCP role

- We now have an Active Directory (AD) Domain Controller (DC) to which we're going to add the DHCP role.
